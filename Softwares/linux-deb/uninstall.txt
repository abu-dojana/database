The video you linked covered installing SQL Server on Linux [1].  Here's how to uninstall it on Ubuntu/Debian systems:

**Uninstalling SQL Server on Ubuntu/Debian systems:**

1. **Stop the SQL Server service:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop mssql-server
   ```

2. **Uninstall the SQL Server package:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt remove mssql-server
   ```

3. **Remove leftover data (optional):**
   The data directory is usually at `/var/lib/mssql`. You can rename it for safety (e.g., `sudo mv /var/lib/mssql /var/lib/mssql_old`) or delete it entirely if you're sure you don't need the data (e.g., `sudo rm -rf /var/lib/mssql`).

4. **Uninstall additional tools (if installed):**
   - **mssql-tools:**
     ```bash
     sudo apt remove mssql-tools
     ```
   - **unixodbc-dev** (needed for mssql-tools):
     ```bash
     sudo apt remove unixodbc-dev
     ```

5. **Uninstall Azure Data Studio (if installed):**
   The package name may vary depending on your distribution. Refer to the official documentation for your system.

**Important notes:**

* Be cautious when removing leftover data, as it can lead to permanent data loss.
* If you encounter any issues during the uninstallation process, consult the official documentation for Microsoft SQL Server on Linux for detailed instructions.
